# Concurrent PDF Processing Guide

## Problem: Rate Limiting with Concurrent Pages

When processing scanned PDFs with Vision API, concurrent requests can hit OpenAI's rate limits:
- ‚ùå `CONCURRENT_PAGES=2` ‚Üí Fails with rate limit errors
- ‚úÖ `CONCURRENT_PAGES=1` ‚Üí Works but too slow

## Solution: Intelligent Retry with Exponential Backoff

The system now automatically:
1. **Detects rate limit errors** (HTTP 429)
2. **Retries with exponential backoff** (1s, 2s, 4s)
3. **Recovers gracefully** without failing the entire job

## Recommended Settings

### For Different OpenAI Tiers

| Tier | RPM Limit | Recommended CONCURRENT_PAGES | Processing Speed |
|------|-----------|------------------------------|------------------|
| **Free** | 3 RPM | 1 | Slow but stable |
| **Tier 1** ($5 spent) | 500 RPM | 2-3 | ‚≠ê Balanced |
| **Tier 2** ($50 spent) | 5,000 RPM | 4-6 | Fast |
| **Tier 3+** ($1,000 spent) | 10,000 RPM | 8-10 | Very fast |

### Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Concurrent PDF Page Processing
VISION_API_CONCURRENT_PAGES=3  # Default: 2

# Optional: Adjust retry settings
VISION_API_MAX_RETRIES=3       # Default: 3
VISION_API_RETRY_DELAY=1000    # Default: 1000ms (1 second)
```

## How It Works

### Without Retry (Old Behavior)
```
Page 1: ‚úÖ Success
Page 2: ‚úÖ Success  
Page 3: ‚ùå Rate limit ‚Üí FAIL entire PDF
```

### With Retry (New Behavior)
```
Page 1: ‚úÖ Success
Page 2: ‚úÖ Success
Page 3: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limit ‚Üí Wait 1s ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success
Page 4: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limit ‚Üí Wait 2s ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success
Page 5: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limit ‚Üí Wait 4s ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success
```

## Monitoring

### Check Logs for Rate Limit Handling

**Success after retry:**
```
[Vision API] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limit hit (attempt 1/4)
[Vision API] Retry attempt 1/3 after 1000ms delay
[Vision API] ‚úÖ Success after 1 retries
```

**Multiple retries:**
```
[Vision API] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limit hit (attempt 1/4)
[Vision API] Retry attempt 1/3 after 1000ms delay
[Vision API] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limit hit (attempt 2/4)
[Vision API] Retry attempt 2/3 after 2000ms delay
[Vision API] ‚úÖ Success after 2 retries
```

**All retries exhausted (rare):**
```
[Vision API] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limit hit (attempt 4/4)
[Vision API] ‚ùå Failed after 3 retries
```

## Performance Comparison

### 10-Page PDF Processing Time

| CONCURRENT_PAGES | Without Retry | With Retry | Notes |
|------------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | 120s | 120s | No rate limits, but slow |
| 2 | ‚ùå FAILS | 70s | ‚úÖ **Recommended** |
| 3 | ‚ùå FAILS | 50s | Good for Tier 1+ |
| 4 | ‚ùå FAILS | 40s | Good for Tier 2+ |
| 6 | ‚ùå FAILS | 35s | Requires Tier 3+ |

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting Rate Limit Failures

**Symptoms:**
```
[Vision API] ‚ùå Failed after 3 retries
Error: rate_limit_exceeded
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce concurrency:**
   ```bash
   VISION_API_CONCURRENT_PAGES=1
   ```

2. **Increase retry delay:**
   ```bash
   VISION_API_RETRY_DELAY=2000  # 2 seconds instead of 1
   ```

3. **Upgrade your OpenAI tier:**
   - Check: https://platform.openai.com/account/limits
   - Tier 1: Spend $5 ‚Üí Get 500 RPM
   - Tier 2: Spend $50 ‚Üí Get 5,000 RPM

### Issue: Processing Too Slow

**Current settings:**
```bash
VISION_API_CONCURRENT_PAGES=1  # Too conservative
```

**Try increasing:**
```bash
VISION_API_CONCURRENT_PAGES=3  # Start here
```

**Monitor logs:**
- If you see `‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limit hit` frequently ‚Üí Reduce
- If you see `‚úÖ Success` consistently ‚Üí Increase

### Issue: Timeout Errors

**Symptoms:**
```
[Vision API] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Timeout error (attempt 1/4)
```

**This is normal for:**
- Large images
- Complex PDFs
- Slow network

**The system will automatically retry.** No action needed unless it fails after all retries.

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Conservative
```bash
# Day 1: Start here
VISION_API_CONCURRENT_PAGES=2
```

### 2. Monitor for 24 Hours
- Check logs for rate limit warnings
- Track success/failure ratio
- Measure processing time

### 3. Adjust Based on Results

**If you see lots of:**
```
[Vision API] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Rate limit hit
```
‚Üí **Reduce concurrency by 1**

**If you see:**
```
[Vision API] ‚úÖ Success (no retries needed)
```
‚Üí **Increase concurrency by 1**

### 4. Find Your Sweet Spot

Keep adjusting until you find the balance between:
- ‚úÖ Fast processing
- ‚úÖ Minimal rate limit hits
- ‚úÖ Successful completion

## Advanced: Dynamic Concurrency

For production environments with varying load:

```bash
# Peak hours (more traffic, more rate limits)
VISION_API_CONCURRENT_PAGES=2

# Off-peak hours (less traffic, higher limits available)
VISION_API_CONCURRENT_PAGES=4
```

Consider implementing:
- Time-based concurrency adjustment
- Adaptive throttling based on recent rate limit history
- Queue-based processing with priority levels

## Rate Limit Reference

### OpenAI Vision API Limits (as of Oct 2024)

| Tier | Requests/Min | Images/Min | Concurrent |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Free | 3 | ~10 | 1 |
| Tier 1 | 500 | ~1,500 | 2-3 |
| Tier 2 | 5,000 | ~15,000 | 4-6 |
| Tier 3 | 10,000 | ~30,000 | 8-10 |

**Note:** Actual limits vary based on model and usage patterns.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Retry logic is now automatic** - no code changes needed
‚≠ê **Start with `CONCURRENT_PAGES=2`** and adjust based on logs
üìä **Monitor your rate limit tier** at https://platform.openai.com/account/limits
üéØ **Optimal setting** = highest concurrency without consistent rate limit hits
