## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Existing Documentation Users

**If you were using:**
- `README.md` → Use **COMPREHENSIVE_AI_CHAT_SYSTEM.md** (more comprehensive)
- Multiple docs for overview → Use **COMPREHENSIVE_AI_CHAT_SYSTEM.md** (single source)
- Text-only docs → Add **SYSTEM_DIAGRAMS_AND_FLOWS.md** (visual understanding)
- Searching for docs → Use **README_NAVIGATION.md** (quick navigation)

**Feature-specific docs remain:**
- `chat-artifacts.md` - Still the authority on tool calling
- `IMAGE_ATTACHMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Still the authority on image processing
- `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Still the authority on integration steps
- `CONTEXT_AWARENESS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Still the authority on memory planning
