### 3. Prerequisites
**Elementary**:
- Grade level progression only

**Junior High**:
- Basic subject sequencing
- Core subject completion

**Senior High**:
- Strict prerequisite checking
- Track/Strand requirements
- Subject sequencing within specializations

### 4. Unit Load
**Elementary & Junior High**:
- Fixed subject load per grade level

**Senior High**:
- Maximum units per semester: 30
- Minimum units per semester: 15
- Track/Strand specific requirements

### 5. Schedule

   - Applies appropriate validation rules and requirements
   - Handles subject loading based on curriculum level

2. **Notifications**
   - System sends notifications to student/parent and registrar
   - Email confirmation sent to primary contact
   - Level-specific enrollment details included

3. **Grade Level Advancement**
   - Automated promotion based on level-specific requirements
   - Different criteria for each education level
   - Considers remedial classes and summer programs

4. **Schedule Assignment**
   - Grade level appropriate section assignment
   - Considers student age and previous performance
   - Maintains optimal class sizes

5. **Transaction Handling**
   - All database operations are wrapped in a transaction
   - Ensures data consistency across all operations
   - Handles rollback for failed enrollments
