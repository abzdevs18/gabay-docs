# Gabay Form - AI Feedback System

> Automatic personalized feedback for every student submission

---

## Overview

The AI Feedback System automatically generates personalized, encouraging feedback for students after they complete assessments. Using advanced GPT models, it analyzes their responses and provides constructive guidance.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Student Submits Form

```
Student fills out exam ‚Üí Clicks Submit
                              ‚Üì
                    API saves response
                              ‚Üì
                    Job queued for processing
                              ‚Üì
                    Student sees confirmation
```

**Time:** <200ms (synchronous)

### 2. Background Processing

```
Worker picks up job ‚Üí Fetches form data
                              ‚Üì
                    Analyzes answers
                              ‚Üì
                    Generates AI prompt
                              ‚Üì
                    Calls OpenAI API
                              ‚Üì
                    Receives feedback
                              ‚Üì
                    Creates email HTML
                              ‚Üì
                    Sends email
```

**Time:** 5-8 seconds (asynchronous)

### 3. Student Receives Email

Beautiful HTML email with:
- Personal greeting
- Completion statistics
- AI-generated feedback
- Study recommendations
- Encouragement

## AI Models

### Supported Models

| Model | Provider | Cost | Speed | Quality |
|-------|----------|------|-------|---------|
| `gpt-4o-mini` | OpenAI | $0.15/1M | Fast | High |
| `gpt-5-nano` | OpenAI | $0.10/1M | Fastest | Good |
| `deepseek-chat` | DeepSeek | Varies | Fast | Good |

### Configuration

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_FEEDBACK_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Override for feedback
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...  # Fallback
```

---

## Automatic Scoring

Before AI feedback generation, the system automatically scores student responses:

### Supported Question Types

| Question Type | Answer Field | Scoring Method |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Multiple Choice** | `correctAnswerIds` | Checks if student's answer ID is in array |
| **True/False** | `correctAnswerIds` | Same as multiple choice |
| **Checkbox** | `correctAnswerIds` | All selected IDs must match (exact match) |
| **Dropdown** | `correctAnswerIds` | Same as multiple choice |
| **Fill-in-Blank** | `correctAnswers` | Case-insensitive string matching |
| **Short Answer** | `correctAnswers` | Multiple acceptable answers supported |
| **Identification** | `correctAnswers` | Trimmed, case-insensitive comparison |
| **Essay** | N/A | Manual grading (no auto-scoring) |

### Scoring Logic

**Choice-Based Questions** (Multiple Choice, True/False, Dropdown):
```typescript
// Student answer: "choice_1"
// Correct answers: ["choice_1"]
isCorrect = correctAnswerIds.includes(studentAnswer);
```

**Multi-Select (Checkbox)**:
```typescript
// Student answer: ["choice_1", "choice_3"]
// Correct answers: ["choice_1", "choice_3"]
isCorrect = studentAnswer.length === correctAnswerIds.length && 
            studentAnswer.every(ans => correctAnswerIds.includes(ans));
```

**Text-Based Questions**:
```typescript
// Student answer: "Photosynthesis"
// Correct answers: ["photosynthesis", "photo synthesis"]
normalizedStudent = studentAnswer.trim().toLowerCase();
isCorrect = correctAnswers.some(ca => 
  ca.trim().toLowerCase() === normalizedStudent
);
```

### Correct Answer Detection

The system intelligently finds correct answers from multiple possible locations:

1. **Primary Fields:**
   - `correctAnswerIds` - For choice-based questions
   - `correctAnswers` - For text-based questions

2. **Legacy Fields:**
   - `correctAnswer`, `answer`, `correct_answer`

3. **Embedded in Options:**
   - `options[].isCorrect = true`
   - `choices[].isCorrect = true`

4. **Validation Objects:**
   - `validation.correctAnswer`
   - `settings.correctAnswer`

This multi-path detection ensures compatibility with forms created by different builders and versions.

### Score Calculation

```
correctCount = number of correct answers
totalQuestions = number of questions with defined correct answers
scorePercentage = (correctCount / totalQuestions) √ó 100
```

**Example:**
- Total Questions: 10
- Correct Answers: 7
- Score: 70%

## Feedback Generation

### AI Prompt

The system uses a carefully crafted prompt:

```
You are an encouraging and supportive K-12 teacher providing 
personalized feedback to students after completing an exam.

Your feedback should:
1. Be warm, encouraging, and age-appropriate
2. Acknowledge effort and completion
3. Identify 2-3 specific strengths based on their answers
4. Suggest 1-2 areas for improvement (gently and constructively)
5. Provide specific study tips related to the exam content
6. End with an encouraging message

Keep the tone positive and motivating.
Length: 250-350 words.
```

## Multi-Tenant Support

### Tenant Isolation

The system maintains complete data isolation:

```
Student submits (Tenant A)
        ‚Üì
Job includes tenantId + tenantToken
        ‚Üì
Worker uses Tenant A's Prisma client
        ‚Üì
Fetches from tenant_a.gabay_forms
        ‚Üì
Email sent with Tenant A branding
```

**Guarantees:**
- ‚úÖ Correct database schema
- ‚úÖ Proper data isolation
- ‚úÖ Tenant-specific emails
- ‚úÖ No cross-tenant leakage

---

## Configuration Options

### Disable AI Feedback

```typescript
// worker-manager.service.ts
const workerManager = WorkerManager.getInstance({
  enableFormResponseWorker: false
});
```

### Adjust Concurrency

```typescript
// form-response-worker.service.ts
concurrency: 5  // Process 5 jobs at once
```

### Change Rate Limit

```typescript
// form-response-queue.service.ts
limiter: {
  max: 20,        // 20 jobs
  duration: 60000 // per minute
}
```

### Switch AI Provider

```bash
# Use DeepSeek instead
OPENAI_FEEDBACK_MODEL=deepseek-chat
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Email Received

**Possible Causes:**
1. Missing `respondentEmail` in form metadata
2. Invalid email address
3. Brevo API key not configured
4. Worker not running

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check worker status
npm run start:workers

# Verify email in metadata
# Form must collect respondentEmail field

# Check Brevo API key
echo $BREVO_API_KEY

# View logs
tail -f logs/worker.log
```

### Generic Feedback

**Cause:** AI API key invalid or quota exceeded

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify OpenAI API key
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Check quota
# https://platform.openai.com/usage
```

### Score Shows 0% Despite Correct Answers

**Cause:** Correct answers not properly configured in form questions

**Solution:**
1. **Check logs** for scoring details:
   ```bash
   [SCORING] Summary: {
     correctCount: 0,
     hasCorrectAnswers: 0  # ‚Üê Should match totalQuestions
   }
   ```

2. **Verify question structure** - ensure questions have:
   - Multiple Choice: `correctAnswerIds` field (array of choice IDs)
   - Text Questions: `correctAnswers` field (array of strings)

3. **Example correct format:**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "MULTIPLE_CHOICE",
     "correctAnswerIds": ["choice_1"],
     "choices": [...]
   }
   ```

4. **Check warning logs:**
   ```bash
   [SCORING] Question "..." missing correct answer
   ```
   This shows which questions lack correct answer definitions.

### Worker Not Processing

**Cause:** Redis connection issue

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Redis
redis-cli ping

# Restart Redis (if needed)
redis-server

# Restart workers
npm run start:workers
```
