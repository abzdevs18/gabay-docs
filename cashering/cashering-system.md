# Cashiering System Implementation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the Cashiering System for the Gabay application. The cashiering system will enable the school to process in-person payments, manage cash drawers, generate receipts, and maintain accurate financial records.

## Database Schema

The cashiering system has added the following models to the existing Prisma schema:

```prisma
// CashierSession model
model CashierSession {
  id            String      @id @default(uuid())
  cashierId     String      // ID of the user acting as cashier

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints have been implemented in the Next.js API routes:

### Cashier Session Endpoints
- `POST /api/v2/finance/cashier` - Open a new cashier session
- `GET /api/v2/finance/cashier` - Get active session for current user
- `GET /api/v2/finance/cashier/sessions/:id` - Get session details
- `PUT /api/v2/finance/cashier/sessions/:id` - Close a cashier session
- `GET /api/v2/finance/cashier/sessions/:id/summary` - Get session summary with transaction totals

### Transaction Endpoints
- `POST /api/v2/finance/cashier/transactions` - Process a new cash transaction
- `GET /api/v2/finance/cashier/transactions` - Get list of transactions (with date and cashier filters)
- `PUT /api/v2/finance/cashier/transactions/:id/void` - Void a transaction

### Cash Drawer Endpoints
- `POST /api/v2/finance/cashier/cash-adjustments` - Record cash-in or cash-out

### Reporting Endpoints
- `GET /api/v2/finance/cashier/reports` - Generate different types of reports (daily summary, collection, transaction)

### Cashier Management Endpoints

## Integration Points

This section outlines how the cashiering system integrates with existing services:

1. **Payment Service Integration**
   - Uses existing payment processing logic
   - Maintains consistent payment records
   - Updates fee statuses using the same workflow

2. **Fee Tracking Integration**
   - Updates student fee balances
   - Maintains accurate payment allocation
   - Preserves fee status transitions

3. **Invoice Integration**
   - Updates invoice statuses
   - Links payments to relevant invoices
   - Maintains invoice payment history

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Type Mismatches

The cashier service implementation includes several workarounds for TypeScript type checking issues:

1. **User Metadata Handling**
   - The User model doesn't explicitly define a `metadata` field in its TypeScript definition
   - Workaround: We use an `ExtendedUser` interface and type assertions to handle metadata properly
   - Note: This is a type-only solution; the database schema does support storing metadata

2. **Student Model Field Access**
   - The Student model doesn't have direct name fields that match what's expected in some API functions
   - Issues encountered with field names like `firstName`, `lastName`, and `studentId`
   - Workaround: 
     - Modified the data access to include the entire student object rather than selecting specific fields
     - Used type assertions (`any`) for the student property to bypass strict type checking
     - Implemented proper fallback display values when formatting transaction data

3. **Type Assertions**
   - In several places, `as unknown as [Type]` assertions are used to bypass strict type checking
   - This is necessary where the Prisma generated types don't fully reflect the database schema
   - These are primarily used in the cashier management functions when handling metadata

These workarounds allow the system to function correctly while maintaining type safety where possible. 

### Future Improvements

To address these issues more thoroughly, consider the following refactoring tasks:

1. **Update Prisma Schema**:
   - Ensure the Prisma schema properly reflects all fields needed by the application
   - Add explicit metadata field to User model if it's a frequently used field

2. **Improve Type Definitions**:
   - Create more accurate TypeScript interfaces that match the actual database schema
   - Reduce reliance on type assertions by properly modeling relationships

3. **Standardize Field Names**:
   - Implement consistent naming conventions across models
   - Document the field mapping for models with unconventional naming
